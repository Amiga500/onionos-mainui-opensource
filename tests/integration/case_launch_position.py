"""A launch still happens when the ROM-list position cannot be saved.

Every other caller of mainui_positions_save() logs and continues; launching must
too. On the device the file is /appconfigs/romwinidx.json on internal flash, so
a full or read-only partition would otherwise block every launch from a list.
Here appconfigs is a regular file, which makes the save fail even as root.
